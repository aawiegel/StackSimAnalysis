# StackSimAnalysis
Code exports and analyzes simulation data to XML from the simulation program [Kinetiscope](http://www.hinsberg.net/kinetiscope/). The directory /cpp/ contains C++ code for export of simulation data into XML format. The /python/ directory contains scripts for postprocessing of the simulation data along with some sample scripts showing how to plot average properties and internal distributions of species.
