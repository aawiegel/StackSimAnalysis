# StackSimAnalysis
Code exports and analyzes simulation data to XML from the simulation program [Kinetiscope](http://www.hinsberg.net/kinetiscope/). The directory /cpp/ contains C++ code for export of simulation data into XML format. The /python/ directory contains scripts for postprocessing of the simulation data. The Jupyter notebook /python/Postprocessing.ipynb demonstrates how the data analysis scripts are used to process data from the simulations. Additional details about these simulations can be found in [this publication](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/cp/c7cp00696a#!divAbstract).
